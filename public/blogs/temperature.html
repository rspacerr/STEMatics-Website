            <h3>What happens if we rise above 1.5° C?</h3>
            <h5>by Leo Barrientos</h5>
            <p style="font-size:18px">
                            Scientists and climate experts around the world have emphasized that global warming can not
                rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius. At the rate we’re going, global warming will surpass the 1.5
                degree mark and reach 2 degrees Celsius by 2036. 2036. That’s in 15 years. That’s within my
                lifetime, and I’m sure it’s within yours as well. This is something that is happening now. But
                here’s another question—one that dives deeper into the reasoning of why you should be
                concerned: what actually happens when we rise above 1.5 degrees?<br><br><br>
                One of the many consequences of climate change is extreme weather, most notably, heat
                waves. At 1.5 degrees, approximately 14% of the Earth’s entire population will be exposed to
                severe heat waves at least once every five years. At 2 degrees, that approximation jumps to
                37% of the Earth’s population. Attempting to limit warming to 1.5 degrees would reduce the
                amount of people exposed to extreme heat waves by 420 million.<br><br><br>
                Climate change also decreases water availability and increases the chances of drought. Limiting
                warming to 1.5 degrees is expected to significantly reduce chances of drought and risks related
                to water availability. At 2 degrees warming, about 61 million more people would be exposed to
                severe drought. Up to 270 million fewer people are expected to be exposed to increases in
                water scarcity at 1.5 degrees warming than at 2 degrees.<br><br><br>
                Sea level is also a common topic that is discussed when it comes to climate change and global
                warming. Limiting temperature increase to 1.5 degrees will still result in sea level rise, due to the
                fact that heat already stored in the oceans from human-produced warming will cause them to
                expand. However, if warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, more than 70% of coastlines will see
                0.66 feet or greater of sea-level rise. This will cause increased coastal flooding, beach erosion,
                salinization of water supplies, and more impacts on humans and other ecological systems.
                About 10.4 million fewer people would be exposed to these risks by 2100 at 1.5 degrees
                warming. The oceans will also become more acidic due to higher concentrations of carbon
                dioxide, which will become higher at 2 degrees warming. This negatively impacts a broad range
                of marine life, and well as humans.<br><br><br>
                Additionally, climate change will disproportionately affect different communities, giving
                low-income communities and communities of color the worse hand. The effects of climate
                change are wide-spread, but the rich will have the upper hand and will be able to pay off the
                effects, while poor and working-class communities can not. For this reason, climate change is
                not only an environmental issue, but also one of social justice.<br><br><br>
                We can not afford for warming to rise above the 1.5 degree threshold—there will be too many
                drastic consequences. This is happening now. We need to learn more about this in order to
                tackle this problem and we must take action before it's too late.<br><br><br>
