            <h3>The Truth About Recycling - How an Eco-Friendly Icon Fares Today</h3>
            <h5>by Leo Barrientos</h5>
            <p style="font-size:18px">
                Since the rapid bolstering of the mainstream movement in the late twentieth century, “reduce, reuse, recycle”
                 has been a staple motto for American environmentalists. The process of recycling has been revered for decades, 
                 though critics argue recycling’s “environmental holiness” has been vastly overblown to the state of hyperbolic
                  delusion. Arguably, the truth about plastic recycling facilitates the great difference between the modern 
                  and traditional waves of environmental activism.<br><br><br>
                PBS Frontline’s documentary Plastic Wars decimates multiple myths and misconceptions about sustainability
                 and recycling. For the longest time, our response to growing mounds of plastic waste has been recycling; yet, 
                 the vast majority of plastics are not recycled. For plastic “clamshells,” the plastic covering on many grocery 
                 products, the recycling process is expensive and complicated. Clamshells are just one example of a “mixed plastic” 
                 that is never actually recycled. Recycling is dependent on the economic viability of the finished product.<br><br><br>
                David Alloway of the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality holds a plastic container in the middle of a grocery store.
                “This package here,” he says, “is technically recyclable. You could recycle this in a lab. But it’s not economical to recycle it given the current economics of recycling.”<br><br><br>
                “I would say that this package is rarely recycled in most parts of the country.”<br><br><br>
                The year is 1970. It is April 22, and environmental concerns are entering the mainstream culture of the United States. 
                Companies are reacting to protests and growing concerns as most businesses do: advertisements. The plastics industry crumbles 
                when guilt festers in consumers and prevents sales. A suffering public image is a suffering company. Dissatisfaction was at a 
                new high, and plastic company executives met to address the issue during the 1980s. A Society of the Plastics Industry board 
                meeting resulted in the formation of the Council for Solid Waste Solutions, with big oil and petrochemical companies like Amoco, Chevron, Dow and Exxon.<br><br><br>
                The major issue? Brands that used plastic were facing bans around the nation.<br><br><br>
                “There was an attitude that if your product was not recycled, then it should not be in the marketplace. So, 
                it was up to us in the plastics industry to solve this problem so that they could continue to package their products in 
                plastic,” said Ronald Liesemer, former head of the Council for Solid Waste Solutions.<br><br><br>
                Plastic bans were averted when the industry funded local recycling programs. Slowly and quietly, laws 
                that required the iconic triangle recycling symbol be put on every plastic container infected the nation. 
                Coy Smith, former board member of the National Recycling Coalition, admits that “making recycling work was 
                a way to keep their products in the marketplace.”<br><br><br>
                Thus, while many products are certainly recyclable, this does not signify they are actually 
                recycled. Only 8.7% of plastics are recycled. Additionally, each recycling deteriorates the quality of the 
                plastic to the point where the only home for plastic is the landfills-- where the infamous material will live the rest 
                of its days for around a thousand years.<br><br><br>
                ... 
                <br><br><br>
                Ethicalconsumer.org describes greenwashing as “the practice of companies launching adverts, campaigns, products etc. 
                under the pretense that they are environmentally beneficial, often in contradiction to their environmental and sustainability 
                record in general. As demand for green products has increased over time, so has the amount of greenwashing.<br><br><br>
                Recycling plastic is the better alternative to simply tossing it away and leaving it to decompose egregiously, painfully slowly. 
                Even if plastic companies are supposedly committing to being “greener,” it does not reverse the decades Americans have been deceived 
                into thinking their plastic use can be sustainable because of recycling.<br><br><br>
                This is not to say that recycling is evil or terrible for the environment. In truth, it can be argued that recycling is one of the most 
                sustainable practices because of its widespread diffusion. Oftentimes other outlets of environmental friendliness are costly in money or 
                time, and still, modern eco-friendly living is inaccessible to the masses. It is essential to recognize the roots of recycling and question 
                how the industry and political lobbying have influenced today.<br><br><br>
