            <h3>Mental Health Awareness in Schools</h3>
            <h5>by Leo Barrientos</h5>

            <h4>What is Mental Health?</h4>
            <p style="font-size:18px">
                Mental health is defined as how one’s actions, thoughts, and feelings affect their
                mental wellbeing. Mental health is not set in stone, but it is ever-present and
                ever-changing depending on one’s circumstances. A mental illness is a condition that
                impacts someone’s thinking, emotions, and mood such that it interferes with their
                ability to function in settings like at home and school. About one in five kids living
                in the U.S. shows signs or symptoms of a mental illness in a given year.<br><br><br>
            </p>
            <h4>Why are so many students and young people suffering from mental health problems?</h4>
            <p style="font-size:18px">
                Anxiety and depression are one of the largest problems facing Generation Z.
                issues, such as excessive alcohol or drug use, bullying, or teen pregnancy, which can
                exacerbate mental health difficulties. Within the last decade, rates of mental
                illness in youth have been on the rise.<br><br><br>
                Young people face pressures, such as achieving high marks and getting admitted
                into a prestigious college. In a study by Pew Research Center, 61% of teens from
                the ages of 13 to 17 reported feeling pressure to achieve good grades, which took
                a toll on their mental health. Michael H. Romanowski, Professor of Education at
                Qatar University, commented on this trend, “Unrestricted access to grades has
                developed into something unproductive and unhealthy, such as parents hovering
                over students. The process has reinforced the idea that grades are all that
                matters.” Other teens in the study cited pressure around social connections and
                others’ perception of them, such as judgement about how they dress or fitting in
                social circles at school and outside of school. Students also felt pressure to
                participate in extracurricular activities and to consistently perform well in sports.
                As shown in the study, young people are experiencing stressors surrounding school,
                peers, and their future. 59% of the teens surveyed planned to attend a 4-year
                college after they graduate high school, so there is overlap between students
                planning to attend a 4-year college and those who reported stress around grades in
                school. . This underscores the impact of pressure around school and one’s academic
                future on mental health.<br><br>

            <!--TODO: Add Image-->
            <p style="font-size:18px">
                The brain has been hardwired to immediately react to a perceived danger or
                threat, which goes back to prehistoric times when humans focused on survival and
                basic needs with no option of thinking towards the future. . Although humanity has
                evolved and we do not have to worry about day-to-day survival, our brains are still
                wired to think the way our ancestors did. A stressor revolving around the future,
                say for example, about college, is registered by the brain as a threat to our
                existence in the current moment. As Associate Professor of Psychiatry and
                Behavioral Sciences Mazen Kheirbek from the University of California states,
                “Anxiety is an emotional response to a perceived threat that’s not actually there in
                front of you”. Although such stresses do not affect the near future, our brain
                experiences a state of constant alarm and threat, which has long-term harms..<br><br><br>

            <h4>How to detect mental distress in students</h4>
            <p style="font-size:18px">
                One of the most identifiable signs that someone is experiencing mental or
                emotional distress is that they become more withdrawn and distant. This might
                manifest in an increase in absences from school and socially isolating from peers.
                The individual may have difficulty maintaining current friendships or fostering new
                ones. They may also experience difficulty maintaining attention and problem
                solving and may complete tasks slower. Over time, if not addressed, this may lead
                to a decline in academic performance, which creates a vicious cycle of stress over
                academics and frustration at results. Another hallmark of mental distress is a
                decrease in energy and interest in hobbies they usually enjoy, detracting time
                usually spent enjoying themself.<br><br><br>
                It is no wonder that only one third of students who have a mental illness go on to
                pursue post-secondary education. The earlier mental health concerns are detected
                and treated, the more likely it is that mental illness will not worsen and cause
                long-term damage. Early detection and intervention may lead to improved academic
                performance and allow young people to build necessary coping skills. .<br><br><br>
            </p>
            <h4>How to help someone with a mental illness</h4>
            <p style="font-size:18px">
                To address academic-related stress and mental health issues, we need to identify
                and address these problems within the school community through initiatives such
                as Pass/Fail grades, more vacations and breaks, etc.. It is important to notice when
                a friend is becoming increasingly distant or withdrawn, support them, and point
                them towards resources and people who can help. Parents should also try to put
                less pressure on their children about grades and turn them into a positive
                challenge.<br><br><br>
